							<p> These books are about a wonderfully strange world that consists of adventure and humanity, and is enjoyed by all ages. This unique world of magical culture and humor will definately appeal to other fans of Harry Potter just like me. There are crazy plot twists, action, and I love the characters that all have a different personality .</p>
